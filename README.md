I know its sad to say but i think im done with fusion its been a long 1.5years of making fusion and i think it's finally time to let it go.
I have had thoughts of letting it go when astro boy was talking about leaking my old source but decided to come back and run it tell it dies and well it sorta happen in a way...
vrc released eac and well lost half there community vrchat devs became drunk dumbasses what only go to clubs in vr to erp since they have no life and killed there community.
Thank you all for helping me get my first car and a gpu i can't thank you all enough.
I might have some future plans involving game cheats for non related vrc shit but for now im taking my brake.
i am done with vrchat i had my fun for the 7 years i been playing ðŸ’€ just never thought vrc would kill their game they made in collage for a project like this too bad all things have to come to an end.
Love you all thank you for supporting me and on my half complete adventure.
